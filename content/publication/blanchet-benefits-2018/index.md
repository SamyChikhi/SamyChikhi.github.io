abstract: Aging is associated with a decreased efﬁciency of different cognitive functions
  as well as in the perceptive, physical and physiological changes. The age-related
  cognitive decline concerns mainly attention, executive control and episodic memory.
  Some factors such as being physically active protect against the age-related decline.
  This review will discuss how physical activity can positively affect the cognitive
  efﬁciency and mental health of older healthy individuals, and possibly reduces the
  risk of progression into dementia, and depression. Underlying neurophysiological
  mechanisms play an important role for improving attention and episodic memory, which
  are the most sensitive to the effects of aging. We also present recommendations
  for the management of physical activity for the prevention of cognitive deﬁcits,
  and the reduction of depressive symptoms in older persons. Given the beneﬁts of
  physical activity for the prevention of neurodegenerative disease and the improvement
  of the well-being, it appears to be an important low cost therapeutic approach that
  should be integrated into clinical practice.
