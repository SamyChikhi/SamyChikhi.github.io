Neurofeedback is a brain-computer interface that trains participants to voluntarily modulate a specific parameter of their brain activity through real-time feedback on their activity. This technique holds promise in unveiling the relationship between brain activity and behavior, while also offering innovative opportunities for neuroenhancement. However, the mechanisms at play and the specific effects of the technique are still poorly understood.
