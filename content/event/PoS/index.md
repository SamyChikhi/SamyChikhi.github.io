summary: ''
abstract: 'The principle of neurofeedback is akin to that of a thermostat: by providing real-time feedback on brain activity, it may be possible to learn to voluntarily regulate this activity. This control over brain activity could potentially aid in relaxation, the treatment of certain disorders, or even the enhancement of memory. Although this technique is appealing, we will see that numerous questions regarding its mechanisms and effectiveness remain open.'
