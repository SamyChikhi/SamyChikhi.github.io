abstract: Neurofeedback (NFB) is a brain-computer interface which allows individuals
  to modulate their brain activity. Despite the self-regulatory nature of NFB, the
  effectiveness of strategies used during NFB training has been little investigated.
  In a single session of NFB training (6*3 min training blocks) with healthy young
  participants, we experimentally tested if providing a list of mental strategies
  (list group, N = 46), compared with a group receiving no strategies (no list group,
  N = 39), affected participants’ neuromodulation ability of high alpha (10–12 Hz)
  amplitude. We additionally asked participants to verbally report the mental strategies
  used to enhance high alpha amplitude. The verbatim was then classified in pre-established
  categories in order to examine the effect of type of mental strategy on high alpha
  amplitude. First, we found that giving a list to the participants did not promote
  the ability to neuromodulate high alpha activity. However, our analysis of the specific
  strategies reported by learners during training blocks revealed that cognitive effort
  and recalling memories were associated with higher high alpha amplitude. Furthermore,
  the resting amplitude of trained high alpha frequency predicted an amplitude increase
  during training, a factor that may optimize inclusion in NFB protocols. The present
  results also corroborate the interrelation with other frequency bands during NFB
  training. Although these findings are based on a single NFB session, our study represents
  a further step towards developing effective protocols for high alpha neuromodulation
  by NFB.
