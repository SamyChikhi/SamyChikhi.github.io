Virtual reality is a technology that provides the opportunity to develop experimental paradigms for sensitively assessing certain cognitive functions. Virtual environments allow, in particular, the evaluation of key aspects of episodic memories (temporality, location) in conditions close to everyday life. Furthermore, virtual reality enables the manipulation of participants' attention levels by modulating the number or salience of certain stimuli.
