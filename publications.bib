	abstract = {Neurofeedback (NFB) is a brain-computer interface which allows individuals to modulate their brain activity. Despite the self-regulatory nature of NFB, the effectiveness of strategies used during NFB training has been little investigated. In a single session of NFB training (6*3 min training blocks) with healthy young participants, we experimentally tested if providing a list of mental strategies (list group, N = 46), compared with a group receiving no strategies (no list group, N = 39), affected participants’ neuromodulation ability of high alpha (10–12 Hz) amplitude. We additionally asked participants to verbally report the mental strategies used to enhance high alpha amplitude. The verbatim was then classified in pre-established categories in order to examine the effect of type of mental strategy on high alpha amplitude. First, we found that giving a list to the participants did not promote the ability to neuromodulate high alpha activity. However, our analysis of the specific strategies reported by learners during training blocks revealed that cognitive effort and recalling memories were associated with higher high alpha amplitude. Furthermore, the resting amplitude of trained high alpha frequency predicted an amplitude increase during training, a factor that may optimize inclusion in NFB protocols. The present results also corroborate the interrelation with other frequency bands during NFB training. Although these findings are based on a single NFB session, our study represents a further step towards developing effective protocols for high alpha neuromodulation by NFB.},

	abstract = {Cognitive workload (CWL) is a fundamental concept in the assessment and monitoring of human performance during cognitive tasks. Numerous studies have attempted to objectively and continuously measure the CWL using neuroimaging techniques. Although the electroencephalogram (EEG) is a widely used technique, the impact of CWL on the spectral power of brain frequencies has shown inconsistent results. The present review aimed to synthesize the results of the literature and quantitatively assess which brain frequency is the most sensitive to CWL. A systematic literature search following PRISMA recommendations highlighted three main frequency bands used to measure CWL: theta (4–8 Hz), alpha (8–12 Hz), and beta (12–30 Hz). Three meta-analyses were conducted to quantitatively examine the effect of CWL on these frequencies. A total of 45 effect sizes from 24 studies involving 723 participants were computed. CWL was associated with significant effects on theta (g = 0.68, CI [0.41, 0.95]), alpha (g = −0.25, CI [−0.45, 0.04]), and beta (g = 0.50, CI [0.21, 0.79]) power. Our results suggests that theta, especially the frontal theta, is the best index of CWL. Alpha and beta power were also significantly impacted by CWL; however, their association seemed less straightforward. These results are critically analyzed considering the literature on cerebral oscillations. We conclude by emphasizing the need to investigate the interaction between CWL and other factors that may influence spectral power (e.g., emotional load), and to combine this measure with other methods of analysis of the central and peripheral nervous system (e.g., functional connectivity, heart rate).},

	abstract = {Aging is associated with a decreased efﬁciency of different cognitive functions as well as in the perceptive, physical and physiological changes. The age-related cognitive decline concerns mainly attention, executive control and episodic memory. Some factors such as being physically active protect against the age-related decline. This review will discuss how physical activity can positively affect the cognitive efﬁciency and mental health of older healthy individuals, and possibly reduces the risk of progression into dementia, and depression. Underlying neurophysiological mechanisms play an important role for improving attention and episodic memory, which are the most sensitive to the effects of aging. We also present recommendations for the management of physical activity for the prevention of cognitive deﬁcits, and the reduction of depressive symptoms in older persons. Given the beneﬁts of physical activity for the prevention of neurodegenerative disease and the improvement of the well-being, it appears to be an important low cost therapeutic approach that should be integrated into clinical practice.},
