abstract: 'Cognitive workload (CWL) is a fundamental concept in the assessment and
  monitoring of human performance during cognitive tasks. Numerous studies have attempted
  to objectively and continuously measure the CWL using neuroimaging techniques. Although
  the electroencephalogram (EEG) is a widely used technique, the impact of CWL on
  the spectral power of brain frequencies has shown inconsistent results. The present
  review aimed to synthesize the results of the literature and quantitatively assess
  which brain frequency is the most sensitive to CWL. A systematic literature search
  following PRISMA recommendations highlighted three main frequency bands used to
  measure CWL: theta (4–8 Hz), alpha (8–12 Hz), and beta (12–30 Hz). Three meta-analyses
  were conducted to quantitatively examine the effect of CWL on these frequencies.
  A total of 45 effect sizes from 24 studies involving 723 participants were computed.
  CWL was associated with significant effects on theta (g = 0.68, CI [0.41, 0.95]),
  alpha (g = −0.25, CI [−0.45, 0.04]), and beta (g = 0.50, CI [0.21, 0.79]) power.
  Our results suggests that theta, especially the frontal theta, is the best index
  of CWL. Alpha and beta power were also significantly impacted by CWL; however, their
  association seemed less straightforward. These results are critically analyzed considering
  the literature on cerebral oscillations. We conclude by emphasizing the need to
  investigate the interaction between CWL and other factors that may influence spectral
  power (e.g., emotional load), and to combine this measure with other methods of
  analysis of the central and peripheral nervous system (e.g., functional connectivity,
  heart rate).'
